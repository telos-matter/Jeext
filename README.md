<b>JEE</b> e<b>xt</b>ension

A, Spring inspired, JEE framework / extension.

<hr>

Unfortunately, this project has been abandoned. **However**, all the features I had in mind initially when I started working on it has been implemented fully, and even some more.


This JEE extension provides facilities to make developing JEE webapps **a lot** easier (with parameters validation, and objects auto-filling, ect...). Similar to what Spring provides. Although worth noting that when I started working on this project I haven't used Spring much / not at all really, yet the features that I've implemented turned out to be very similar to what Spring has.

And so:
- The project as it is right now is functional, but would **NOT** recommend **AT ALL** using it in any production environment. If you are just working on a school project though, would highly recommend, it is in fact what motivated me to start working on this project in the first place.
- It lacks documentation, for both some of the code and a how-to use it guide. So unless you're willing to dig into the code, it's not going to be very useful to you.
