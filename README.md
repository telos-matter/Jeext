<b>JEE</b> e<b>xt</b>ension

A, Spring inspired, JEE framework / extension.

<hr>

Unfortunately, this project has been abandoned. **However**, all the features I had in mind initially when I started working on it have been implemented fully, and even some more.


This JEE extension provides facilities to make developing JEE webapps **a lot** easier (with parameters validation, and objects auto-filling, ect...). Similar to what Spring provides. Although worth noting that when I started working on this project I haven't used Spring much / not at all really, yet the features that I've implemented turned out to be very similar to what Spring has.

And so:
- The project as it is right now is functional, but would **NOT** recommend **AT ALL** using it in any production environment. If you are just working on a school project where you are only allowed to use JEE though, then I would highly recommend. It is in fact what motivated me to start working on this project in the first place, because we were constrained to only use JEE and absolutly no frameworks, and so I made my own framework around JEE, thanks to [Java's reflection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/package-summary.html).
- The project also lacks documentation, for both some of the code/classes and a how-to use it type-of guide. So unless you're willing to dig into the code, it's not going to be very useful to/ easy for you.
